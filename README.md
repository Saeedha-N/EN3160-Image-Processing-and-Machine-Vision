#  Intensity Transformations and Neighborhood Filtering

This focuses on image processing tasks related to intensity transformations, neighborhood filtering, and advanced image processing techniques. Below is a summary of the tasks in the assignment:

1. Implement an intensity transformation on a given image and report the parameters of the transformation.

2. Apply a similar operation to accentuate white and gray matter in a brain proton density image.

3. Apply gamma correction to an image and visualize the histograms of the original and corrected images.

4. Enhance the vibrance of a photograph using a specified intensity transformation.

5. Implement histogram equalization on an image and display histograms before and after equalization.

6. Perform histogram equalization on the foreground of an image and combine it with the background.

7. Apply Sobel filtering to compute the gradient of an image.

8. Write a program to zoom images with nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation and calculate the normalized sum of squared differences (SSD) when scaling up small images.

9. Use GrabCut for image segmentation, produce an enhanced image with a blurred background, and discuss why the background beyond the flower's edge appears dark.
